# Given: 
- Two integer arrays "nums1" and "nums2"
- Both arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order

# Objective: 
- return the minimum integer common to both arrays


# Fail-Safe:
- No common integers?
	-  If there is no common integer amongst `nums1` and `nums2`, return `-1`

# Problem-defined terms:
- common
	-  An integer is said to be **common** to `nums1` and `nums2` if both arrays have **at least one** occurrence of that integer.


# Example Inputs/Outputs:
Input_1: `nums1 = [1, 2, 3]`, `nums2 = [2, 4]`
Output_1: 2
Input_2: `nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 6]`, `nums2 = [2, 3, 4, 5]`
Output_2: 2


# Things I learned:
* Pressing the scroll wheel, gives the cool scroll wheel option
* non-decreasing means increasing but you can get the same number within the sequence
