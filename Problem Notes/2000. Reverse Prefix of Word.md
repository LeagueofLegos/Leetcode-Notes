https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-prefix-of-word/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=ajc81mgt

# Given: 
- 0-indexed string word
- character ch

# Objective: 
**reverse** the segment of `word` that starts at index `0` and ends at the index of the **first occurrence** of `ch` (**inclusive**)
# Recorded Errors/Solutions:
# Questions:
- Why does the problem explicitly state the strings given being a 0-indexed string word?
- Why is the big O notation for swapping elements in an array O(1) when I think it should be O(n) since you're constantly creating/storing a variable within a loop?
