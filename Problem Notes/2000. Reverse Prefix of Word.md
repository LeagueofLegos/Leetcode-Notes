# PROBLEM LINK
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-prefix-of-word/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=ajc81mgt

# Given: 
- 0-indexed string word
- character ch

# Objective: 
**reverse** the segment of `word` that starts at index `0` and ends at the index of the **first occurrence** of `ch` (**inclusive**)
# Recorded Errors/Solutions:
# Questions:
- Why does the problem explicitly state the strings given being a 0-indexed string word?
- Why is the big O notation for swapping elements in an array O(1) when I think it should be O(n) since you're constantly creating/storing a variable within a loop?
	- The loop itself causes the time/space complexity to increase not the variables defined in the loop which are only seen as constants when moving towards infinity

## Completion 1:
Solution Code:
``` 
	class Solution {
	
	public:
	
	string reversePrefix(string word, char ch) {
	
		int j = 0;
	
	
	
		for (int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++) {
	
			if (word[i] == ch) {
	
				for(int k = i; k >= j; k--) {
	
					int temp = word[k];
	
					word[k] = word[j];
	
					word[j] = temp;
	
					j++;  
	
				}
	
				return word;
	
			}
	
		}
	
		return word;
	
	}
	
	};
