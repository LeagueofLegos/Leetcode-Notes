https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=ajc81mgt

# Given: 
integer array nums


# Objective: 
move allÂ 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.


# Fail-Safe:
- TLE error?
	- algorithm must be in-place without making a copy of the array.
# Problem-defined terms: 


# Example Inputs/Outputs:
Input_1: `nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`
Output_1: `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`
Input_2: `nums = [0]`
Output_2: `[0]`

# Things I learned:
- push_back() adds a new element to the end of an array
- A for loop is for definite iteration while a while loop is for indefinite iteration
- for loops contain an initialization, condition, and updation all in one line while a while loop contain an initialization, condition, and updation all in different lines
